# ✅ Whiteboard - Perfect UX Structure!

## 🎯 How It Works Now

Your whiteboard has the **best possible UX** - similar to Figma, Miro, and other professional tools:

### 📁 Two-Part Structure

```
1. Landing Page (WITH sidebar/header)
   → app/(dashboard)/whiteboard/page.tsx
   → URL: /whiteboard
   → Has: Sidebar, Header, Create/Join buttons

2. Canvas Room (FULL-SCREEN)
   → app/whiteboard/[roomId]/page.tsx
   → URL: /whiteboard/abc123
   → No sidebar/header - pure canvas!
```

## 🎨 User Flow

### Step 1: Navigate to Whiteboard

```
Dashboard → Sidebar → Tools → Whiteboard
   ↓
Loads /whiteboard page
   ↓
Shows: Sidebar + Header + Create/Join cards
```

### Step 2: Create or Join

```
Click "Create Whiteboard" or enter room ID
   ↓
Navigates to /whiteboard/[roomId]
   ↓

```

### Step 3: Collaborate

```

   ↓

   ↓
Real-time collaboration with Yjs + Liveblocks
```

### Step 4: Exit

   ↓

```
