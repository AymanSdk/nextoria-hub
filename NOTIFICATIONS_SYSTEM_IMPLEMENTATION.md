## Next Steps - Integration Required

To fully activate the notifications system, you need to integrate notification triggers into your existing API routes and actions:

### Tasks Integration

Add to task API routes (`app/api/tasks/*`):

```typescript
import {
  notifyTaskAssigned,
  notifyTaskStatusChanged,
} from "@/src/lib/notifications/service";
import {
  logTaskCreated,
  logTaskStatusChanged,
} from "@/src/lib/notifications/activity-logger";

// When creating a task
await logTaskCreated({
  workspaceId,
  userId,
  taskId,
  taskTitle,
  projectName,
});

// When assigning a task
await notifyTaskAssigned({
  taskId,
  taskTitle,
  assigneeId,
  assignedBy,
  projectName,
});

// When changing task status
await notifyTaskStatusChanged({
  taskId,
  taskTitle,
  notifyUserId,
  oldStatus,
  newStatus,
  changedBy,
});
await logTaskStatusChanged({
  workspaceId,
  userId,
  taskId,
  taskTitle,
  oldStatus,
  newStatus,
});
```

### Projects Integration

  invoiceNumber,
  amount,
  currency,
});
```

### Files Integration

Add to file API routes (`app/api/files/*`):

```typescript
import { notifyFileUploaded } from "@/src/lib/notifications/service";
import { logFileUploaded } from "@/src/lib/notifications/activity-logger";

// When uploading file
await notifyFileUploaded({
  fileId,
  fileName,
  uploadedBy,

});
```

### Approvals Integration

  requestedBy,
});

// When approval decision is made
await notifyApprovalDecision({
  approvalId,
  title,
  requesterId,
  decision,
  decidedBy,
});
```

### Expenses Integration

Add to expense API routes (`app/api/expenses/*`):

```typescript
import {
  notifyExpenseSubmitted,
  notifyExpenseDecision,
} from "@/src/lib/notifications/service";

// When submitting expense
await notifyExpenseSubmitted({
  expenseId,

});
```

### Client Requests Integration

```typescript
import { notifyClientRequest } from "@/src/lib/notifications/service";

// When client submits request
await notifyClientRequest({
  requestId,
  title,

});
```

### Team Integration

Add to team/invitation API routes:

```typescript
import { notifyTeamMemberJoined } from "@/src/lib/notifications/service";

  workspaceId,
  userId,
  memberName,
  role,
});
```

### Comments Integration

import { notifyTaskComment } from "@/src/lib/notifications/service";

// When commenting on task
await notifyTaskComment({
  taskId,
  taskTitle,
  commentAuthor,
  commentPreview,
  notifyUserId,
});
```

### Mentions Integration

Add to chat/comment systems:

```typescript
import { notifyMention } from "@/src/lib/notifications/service";

// When user is mentioned
await notifyMention({
  mentionedUserId,
  mentionedBy,
  context,
  contextUrl,
});
```

## Database Migration

**IMPORTANT:** You must run the database migration to create the new tables:

```bash
bun run db:push
```

This will:

- Create the `activity_logs` table
- Update the `notifications` table enum with new types
- Update the `notification_preferences` table with new fields

## Testing

After integration, test the following:

1. **Notification Creation:**

   - Perform actions that should trigger notifications
   - Check `/notifications` to see if they appear
   - Verify unread count in header bell

2. **Activity Feed:**

   - Check homepage for recent activities
   - Verify activities are logged correctly
   - Test filtering (admins see all, users see own)

3. **Notification Preferences:**

   - Go to `/settings/notifications`
   - Toggle various preferences
   - Verify they're saved correctly

4. **Email Notifications:**

   - Ensure email service is configured
   - Test that emails are sent based on preferences
   - Note: Email sending depends on your SMTP configuration

5. **Real-time Polling:**
   - Keep app open for 60+ seconds
   - Create a notification in another browser/incognito
   - Verify it appears after next poll

## Configuration

### Email Service

The email service (`src/lib/notifications/email.ts`) should already be configured. Ensure these environment variables are set:

```env
SMTP_HOST=your-smtp-host
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-smtp-user
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-smtp-password
SMTP_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

### Polling Interval

The notification polling interval is set to 60 seconds in:

- `components/notifications/notification-bell.tsx`
- `hooks/use-notifications-poll.ts`

You can adjust this if needed (shorter = more real-time but more API calls).

## Optional Enhancements

### Background Jobs (Future)

For production, consider adding cron jobs for:

- Daily task due reminders (check tasks due within 24 hours)
- Overdue invoice notifications
- Daily/weekly digest emails

Create `src/lib/notifications/cron.ts` and set up with Vercel Cron or similar.

### WebSocket Support (Future)

For truly real-time notifications, consider replacing polling with WebSockets:

- Use Socket.io or native WebSockets
- Push notifications immediately when created
- More efficient than polling for high-traffic apps

## Files Summary

**Created:**

- src/db/schema/activity-logs.ts
- src/lib/notifications/activity-logger.ts
- components/notifications/notification-bell.tsx
- components/notifications/notification-item.tsx
- components/notifications/notification-preferences-form.tsx
- components/dashboard/activity-feed.tsx
- app/(dashboard)/notifications/notifications-client.tsx
- app/(dashboard)/settings/notifications/page.tsx
- app/api/notifications/route.ts
- app/api/notifications/[id]/route.ts
- app/api/notifications/unread-count/route.ts
- app/api/notifications/mark-all-read/route.ts
- app/api/notifications/preferences/route.ts
- app/api/activity/route.ts
- hooks/use-notifications-poll.ts

**Modified:**

- src/db/schema/notifications.ts (expanded types and preferences)
- src/db/schema/index.ts (added activity logs export)
- src/lib/notifications/service.ts (added 15+ helper functions)
- app/(dashboard)/notifications/page.tsx (simplified to use client component)
- app/(dashboard)/page.tsx (added activity feed)
- components/layout/app-header.tsx (added notification bell)

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Polling vs WebSocket:** Chose 60-second polling as it's simpler and sufficient for most use cases
2. **Separate Activity Logs:** Activity logs table separate from notifications for flexibility
3. **Granular Preferences:** Per-category controls give users maximum control
4. **Smart Defaults:** Email enabled for critical notifications, disabled for status updates
5. **Workspace Scoped:** All notifications and activities are workspace-scoped
6. **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript support with proper types throughout

## Support

For questions or issues:

1. Check the API route implementations in `app/api/notifications/`
2. Review notification service functions in `src/lib/notifications/service.ts`
3. Look at component examples in `components/notifications/`
4. Check the plan document: `complete-notifications-system.plan.md`
