# âœ… Client File Access Security - Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive file access control for the client portal. Clients now can **only** see and download files related to them or their projects.

## What Was Fixed

### ðŸ”’ Security Issues Resolved

1. **Files Page** - Clients could see ALL files in the system

   - âœ… Now filtered to show only client's files and project files

2. **File Downloads** - Clients could download any file if they knew the file ID

   - âœ… Now requires authorization check before generating download URL

3. **Deliverables API** - Clients could request any client's deliverables

   - âœ… Now restricted to only their own deliverables

4. **File Deletion** - Clients could delete files they uploaded
   - âœ… Now completely blocked from deleting any files

## Files Modified

```

## How It Works

### For Clients (CLIENT role)

1. **File Listing** (`/files` page)

   - System finds client record by email
   - Gets all projects assigned to client
   - Shows only files where:
     - `file.clientId` matches their client record, OR
     - `file.projectId` is in their list of projects

2. **File Downloads**

   - Verifies file belongs to client before generating download URL
   - Returns 403 Forbidden if unauthorized

3. **Deliverables**

   - Can only request deliverables for their own client ID
   - Returns 403 Forbidden if requesting other clients' data

4. **File Deletion**
   - Completely blocked from deleting any files
   - Returns 403 Forbidden on any delete attempt

### For Team Members (non-CLIENT roles)

- âœ… Can see all files
- âœ… Can download all files
- âœ… Can delete files they uploaded (or admins can delete any)
- âœ… No restrictions on file access

## Testing Checklist

### âœ… Client Tests

- [ ] Log in as a client
- [ ] Visit `/files` page
- [ ] Verify only their files appear
- [ ] Try to download their files (should work)
- [ ] Try to delete a file (should fail with 403)

### âœ… Team Member Tests

- [ ] Log in as a team member
- [ ] Visit `/files` page
- [ ] Verify all files appear
- [ ] Download any file (should work)
- [ ] Delete own file (should work)

### âœ… Security Tests

- [ ] Client tries to access another client's deliverables via API (should return 403)
- [ ] Client tries to download file from another client's project (should return 403)
- [ ] Client tries to delete any file (should return 403)

## Database Schema (No Changes Required)

The implementation uses existing schema:

```sql
files
â”œâ”€â”€ id
â”œâ”€â”€ clientId â†’ clients.id     (Used for filtering)
â”œâ”€â”€ projectId â†’ projects.id   (Used for filtering)
â”œâ”€â”€ uploadedBy â†’ users.id
â””â”€â”€ ...

projects
â”œâ”€â”€ id
â”œâ”€â”€ clientId â†’ clients.id     (Links project to client)
â””â”€â”€ ...

clients
â”œâ”€â”€ id
â”œâ”€â”€ email                     (Matches user email)
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## API Endpoints Updated

| Endpoint                              | Method | Authorization Added       |
| ------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------- |
| `/api/files`                          | GET    | âœ… Client filtering       |
| `/api/deliverables`                   | GET    | âœ… Client access control  |
| `/api/deliverables/[fileId]/download` | GET    | âœ… Download authorization |
| `/api/deliverables/[fileId]`          | DELETE | âœ… Client deletion block  |

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Task File Filtering** - Filter task files based on client projects
2. **Audit Logging** - Enhanced logging of unauthorized access attempts
3. **File Sharing** - Explicit file sharing between team and clients
4. **Granular Permissions** - Project-level file visibility settings
5. **File Upload Restrictions** - Limit what clients can upload

## Support

If issues arise:

1. Verify client record email matches login email
2. Check project assignments to clients
3. Ensure files are properly linked to clients or projects
4. Review `file_access_log` table for access attempts
