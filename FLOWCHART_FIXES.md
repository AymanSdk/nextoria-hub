# ðŸ”§ Flowchart Issues Fixed

## Issues Resolved

### âœ… Issue 1: Templates Were Empty

**Problem:** When using a template, the canvas would load but with no nodes or edges.

**Root Cause:**

- The `FlowchartCanvas` component had hardcoded empty initial state
- The collaborative wrapper couldn't pass initial data to the canvas
- Template data from Liveblocks wasn't being applied

**Solution:**

- Modified `FlowchartCanvas` to accept `initialNodes` and `initialEdges` props
- Added `onStateChange` callback to notify parent of changes
- Updated collaborative wrapper to properly initialize with template data from Liveblocks

**Files Modified:**

- `components/flowchart/flowchart-canvas.tsx` - Added props interface
- `components/flowchart/collaborative-flowchart-canvas.tsx` - Complete state management rewrite

---

### âœ… Issue 2: Save Toolbar Overlapping Tools Toolbar

**Problem:** The save toolbar was positioned at `top-4` which overlapped with the comprehensive toolbar.

**Solution:**

- Changed save toolbar position from `top-4` to `top-16` (64px from top)
- This gives enough clearance for the tools toolbar

**Files Modified:**

- `components/flowchart/flowchart-save-toolbar.tsx` - Updated positioning

---

### âœ… Issue 3: Can't Save Flowchart

**Problem:** Save functionality wasn't working because the collaborative wrapper couldn't access the canvas state.

**Root Cause:**

- `FlowchartCanvas` managed its own internal state
- No way for parent to know when nodes/edges changed
- Auto-save and manual save had no data to work with

**Solution:**

- Added `onStateChange` callback prop to `FlowchartCanvas`
- Collaborative wrapper now maintains `currentNodes` and `currentEdges` state
- State changes trigger:
  1. Update to Liveblocks (real-time collaboration)
  2. Queue auto-save to database
  3. Update local state for manual save

**Files Modified:**

- `components/flowchart/flowchart-canvas.tsx` - Added state change notification
- `components/flowchart/collaborative-flowchart-canvas.tsx` - Proper state management

## How It Works Now

### Template Loading Flow:

```
1. User clicks "Use Template" â†’ Navigate to /flowchart/{id}?template={templateId}
2. Page loads template data via getTemplateById()
3. Template data passed to FlowchartRoomProvider as initialData
4. FlowchartRoomProvider initializes Liveblocks storage with template data
5. CollaborativeFlowchartCanvas checks Liveblocks storage
6. Finds template data and sets it as currentNodes/currentEdges
7. Passes to FlowchartCanvas via initialNodes/initialEdges props
8. âœ… Template renders immediately!
```

### Save Flow:

```
1. User edits flowchart (adds/moves nodes, connects edges)
2. FlowchartCanvas calls onStateChange(newNodes, newEdges)
3. CollaborativeFlowchartCanvas receives callback:
   a. Updates currentNodes/currentEdges state
   b. Updates Liveblocks storage (updateNodes/updateEdges)
   c. Queues auto-save to database (queueAutoSave)
4. After 10 seconds of no changes, auto-save triggers
5. API POST/PUT request to /api/flowcharts/[id]
6. âœ… Flowchart saved to database!
```

### Manual Save Flow:

```
1. User clicks "Save" button in toolbar
2. handleManualSave() called with currentNodes/currentEdges
3. handleSave() from useFlowchartSave hook
4. If flowchartId exists: PUT to /api/flowcharts/[id]
5. If new flowchart: POST to /api/flowcharts
6. Returns new ID, updates flowchartId state
7. âœ… Immediate save confirmation!
```

## Component Architecture

### FlowchartCanvas

- Now accepts external initial data
- Notifies parent of all state changes
- Still manages own state internally for undo/redo
- Can be used standalone OR with collaborative wrapper

### CollaborativeFlowchartCanvas

- Manages synchronization between:
  - Local state (currentNodes/currentEdges)
  - Liveblocks storage (real-time collaboration)
  - Database (persistence)
- Handles initial data loading priority:
  1. Liveblocks storage (template or existing data)
  2. Database (saved flowchart)
  3. Empty (new flowchart)

### FlowchartSaveToolbar

- Positioned to avoid toolbar overlap
- Shows save status and active users
- Editable flowchart name
- Manual save button

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Create new flowchart â†’ Should work
- [x] Use template â†’ Template loads with all nodes/edges
- [x] Edit nodes â†’ Changes should trigger auto-save after 10s
- [x] Manual save â†’ Click "Save" button works immediately
- [x] Real-time collaboration â†’ Open same room in 2 windows, edits sync
- [x] Template name â†’ Shows in save toolbar
- [x] No toolbar overlap â†’ Save toolbar below tools toolbar
- [x] Save indicator â†’ Shows "Saved", "Saving", or "Unsaved changes"

## Known Limitations

1. **Initial Load Performance:** The canvas re-initializes when receiving props changes. This is by design to support template loading but could be optimized.

2. **Undo/Redo with Templates:** The undo/redo history starts from the template state, not empty canvas. This is expected behavior.

3. **Auto-save Delay:** There's a 10-second delay before auto-save. Changes during this window are in Liveblocks but not yet in the database.

## ðŸŽ‰ Result

All three issues are now fixed:

- âœ… Templates load with full content
- âœ… Toolbars don't overlap
- âœ… Save functionality works (auto-save + manual save)
