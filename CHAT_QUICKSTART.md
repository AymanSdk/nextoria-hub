# 🚀 Chat Feature - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

Your Nextoria Hub now has a **fully functional real-time chat system**! Here's what's ready:

- ✅ **Liveblocks packages installed** (v3.9.1)
- ✅ **8 API routes created** (channels, messages, auth)
- ✅ **5 React components built** (chat UI)
- ✅ **Database schema ready** (already in your codebase)
- ✅ **Beautiful UI with ShadCN components**
- ✅ **TypeScript types configured**
- ✅ **Real-time presence & typing indicators**

---

## 🎯 Get Started in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Create Liveblocks Account (5 minutes)

1. Go to **[liveblocks.io](https://liveblocks.io)**
2. Click **"Sign Up"** (it's free!)
3. Create a new project (name it "Nextoria Hub")
4. Go to **"API Keys"** in the dashboard
5. Copy your **Secret Key** (starts with `sk_prod_...` or `sk_dev_...`)

### Step 2: Add Environment Variable (1 minute)

Create/edit your `.env` file and add:

```env
LIVEBLOCKS_SECRET_KEY="sk_dev_paste_your_key_here"
```

💡 **Tip**: Use `sk_dev_` keys for development, `sk_prod_` for production

### Step 3: Run Database Migration (1 minute)

```bash
bun run db:push
```

This creates three tables:

- `chat_channels`
- `chat_messages`
- `chat_channel_members`
