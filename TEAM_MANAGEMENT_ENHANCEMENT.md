## 🔍 Technical Details

### Component Architecture

```
TeamManagementPage (Server Component)
  ├── Fetches team members from database
  ├── Fetches workspace information
  └── Passes data to TeamBrowser

TeamBrowser (Client Component)
  ├── State Management
  │   ├── Team members
  │   ├── Clients
  │   ├── Active tab
  │   └── View mode
  ├── Tabs
  │   ├── Team Members Tab
  │   │   ├── List View
  │   │   ├── Grid View
  │   │   └── Compact View
  │   └── Clients Tab
  │       ├── List View
  │       ├── Grid View
  │       └── Compact View
  └── Actions
      ├── Invite Team Member
      └── Add Client
```

### Data Flow

1. Server component fetches initial team members
2. Client component fetches clients via API
3. State updates trigger view re-renders
4. Actions trigger API calls and refetch data

### Performance Optimizations

- Initial data passed from server (no loading state for team)
- Client-side caching of view mode preference
- Efficient re-renders using React state
- Lazy loading of client data
