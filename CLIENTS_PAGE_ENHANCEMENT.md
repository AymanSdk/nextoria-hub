## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Client-Side State

```typescript
- clients: Client[]
- searchQuery: string
- filterIndustry: string ("all" | industry name)
- filterStatus: string ("all" | "active" | "inactive")
- sortField: "name" | "company" | "email" | "industry" | "createdAt"
- sortOrder: "asc" | "desc"
- viewMode: "list" | "grid" | "compact"
- selectedClients: Set<string>
```

### Computed Values (useMemo)

```typescript
- industries: string[] - Unique industries from clients
- filteredAndSortedClients: Client[] - After search, filter, sort
- stats: { total, active, thisMonth, withIndustry }
```

### Performance Optimizations

- ✅ useMemo for expensive computations
- ✅ Efficient filtering and sorting
- ✅ Set-based selection for O(1) lookup
