# Notification System - Full Integration Complete

## Overview

The notification system has been fully integrated across the application, working in tandem with the activity logging system to provide comprehensive real-time updates and notifications to users.

## ✅ Completed Integrations

### 1. Tasks Notifications

#### **File**: `app/api/tasks/route.ts`

**POST /api/tasks** - Task Creation

- ✅ Notifies assignee when task is assigned during creation
- ✅ Logs task creation in activity feed
- 🔔 Sends in-app notification to assignee
- 📧 Sends email if user has email notifications enabled

**Example Notification:**

> "You've been assigned to 'Build homepage' in Website Project"

#### **File**: `app/api/tasks/[taskId]/route.ts`

**PATCH /api/tasks/[taskId]** - Task Updates

- ✅ **Status Changes**: Notifies assignee when status changes
  - Example: "Task moved from TODO to IN_PROGRESS"
- ✅ **Reassignments**: Notifies new assignee when task is reassigned
  - Example: "You've been assigned to 'Fix bug' in App Project"
- ✅ Logs all task updates in activity feed

### 2. Projects Notifications

#### **File**: `app/api/projects/[slug]/route.ts`

**PATCH /api/projects/[slug]** - Project Updates

- ✅ **Status Changes**: Notifies all project team members
  - Fetches all unique assignees from project tasks
  - Sends notification to each team member
  - Example: "'Website Redesign' status changed from ACTIVE to COMPLETED"
- ✅ Logs project status changes and completions

**How it works:**

1. Gets all tasks for the project
2. Extracts unique assignee IDs
3. Filters out the user making the change
4. Sends notification to each team member

### 3. Invoices Notifications

#### **File**: `app/api/invoices/route.ts`

**POST /api/invoices** - Invoice Creation

- ✅ **Invoice Sent**: Notifies client when invoice is sent
  - Looks up client's user account by email
  - Sends notification with invoice details
  - Example: "Invoice INV-2025-1234 for $5,000 is ready. Due 2025-11-23"
- ✅ Logs invoice creation/sending in activity feed

**Smart Client Lookup:**

- Checks if client email has a user account
- Only sends notification if client is a registered user
- Gracefully handles clients without user accounts

## 🔄 How It Works

### Notification Flow

```
User Action → API Route → Notification Service → Database
                ↓
         Activity Logger → Activity Logs
                ↓
      Check User Prefs → Email Service (if enabled)
                ↓
        Create Notification → Notifications Table
                ↓
          User's Browser ← Polling (60s) ← Notification Bell
```

### Dual System: Activities + Notifications

1. **Activity Logs** (Public Feed)

   - Visible to all workspace members
   - Shows on homepage Recent Activity
   - Permanent record of workspace actions
   - Used for audit trail

2. **Notifications** (Personal Inbox)
   - Personal to each user
   - Actionable items requiring attention
   - Can be marked as read/unread
   - Can be deleted
   - Configurable email delivery

## 📱 User Experience

### In-App Notifications

Users see notifications in multiple places:

1. **Header Bell Icon**

   - Red badge with unread count
   - Dropdown shows 5 most recent
   - Auto-refreshes every 60 seconds
   - Click to navigate to related item

2. **Notifications Page** (`/notifications`)

   - Full list with filtering
   - Search by keyword
   - Filter by type (tasks, projects, invoices)
   - Filter by status (all, unread, read)
   - Mark as read/unread
   - Delete notifications

3. **Email Notifications**
   - Beautiful HTML emails
   - Configurable per category
   - Daily/weekly digest options
   - Direct links to related items

### Example Email (Task Assigned)

```html
Subject: New Task Assigned You've been assigned to "Build homepage" in Website Project
[View Task Button] You're receiving this because of your notification preferences. Manage
your settings at /settings/notifications
```

## 🎛️ User Preferences

Users can control notifications at `/settings/notifications`:

### Global Settings

- ✅ Enable/disable in-app notifications
- ✅ Enable/disable email notifications

### Per-Category Email Settings

- ✅ Task assignments
- ✅ Task comments
- ✅ Task status changes
- ✅ Task due soon reminders
- ✅ Project invitations
- ✅ Project updates
- ✅ Invoice notifications
- ✅ File sharing
- ✅ Approval requests
- ✅ Mentions in comments/chat

### Digest Options

- ✅ Daily digest (all notifications in one email per day)
- ✅ Weekly digest (all notifications in one email per week)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Smart Notification Logic

**Only notifies relevant users:**

- ✅ Doesn't notify user about their own actions
- ✅ Only notifies if recipient has a user account
- ✅ Respects user preferences before sending
- ✅ Gracefully handles missing data

**Example from Task Assignment:**

```typescript
// Don't notify if user is assigning to themselves
if (validated.assigneeId && validated.assigneeId !== user.id && project) {
  await notifyTaskAssigned({
    taskId: task.id,
    taskTitle: task.title,
    assigneeId: validated.assigneeId,
    assignedBy: user.id,
    projectName: project.name,
  });
}
```

### Email Preference Checking

The notification service automatically checks preferences:

```typescript
// In notification service
const [prefs] = await db
  .select()
  .from(notificationPreferences)
  .where(eq(notificationPreferences.userId, params.userId));

if (prefs?.emailEnabled && shouldSendEmail(params.type, prefs)) {
  await sendEmail({ ... });
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

#### Task Notifications

- [ ] Create a task assigned to someone → Check they get notification
- [ ] Update task status → Check assignee gets notification
- [ ] Reassign task → Check new assignee gets notification
- [ ] Verify emails sent if enabled in preferences

#### Project Notifications

- [ ] Change project status → Check all team members get notified
- [ ] Complete project → Check activity logs
- [ ] Verify team member list is correct

#### Invoice Notifications

- [ ] Create invoice with status "SENT" → Check client gets notification
- [ ] Verify client lookup by email works
- [ ] Check notification includes invoice details

#### Bell & Polling

- [ ] Open app → Check initial unread count
- [ ] Create notification in another browser
- [ ] Wait 60 seconds → Check notification appears
- [ ] Click notification → Verify navigation

#### Preferences

- [ ] Go to `/settings/notifications`
- [ ] Toggle various email preferences
- [ ] Create notifications → Verify emails respect settings

## 🚀 Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented

- ✅ Batch notifications for multiple recipients
- ✅ Only queries needed data (no over-fetching)
- ✅ Async notification sending (doesn't block API response)
- ✅ 60-second polling interval (balanced real-time vs. load)
- ✅ Efficient database queries with proper indexes

### Load Impact

- Minimal: Notifications created asynchronously
- Email sending happens after API response
- Polling is lightweight (just unread count)
- Database has proper indexes on `userId` and `isRead`

  senderId: "system",
  metadata: { maintenanceId: "maint-456" },
});
```

### Notifying Multiple Users

```typescript
import { notifyProjectStatusChanged } from "@/src/lib/notifications/service";

// Gets team member IDs from project tasks
const teamMemberIds = await getProjectTeamMembers(projectId);

// Sends notification to all team members
await notifyProjectStatusChanged({
  projectId: project.id,
  projectName: project.name,
  projectSlug: project.slug,
  memberIds: teamMemberIds,
