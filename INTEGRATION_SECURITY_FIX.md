# 🔒 Critical Security Fix: Admin-Only Integration Management

## ⚠️ Issue Identified

**CRITICAL SECURITY FLAW:** Any workspace member could connect/disconnect Google Drive integration, potentially causing data leaks and service disruption.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

Following the **Slack/ClickUp security model**, only **workspace administrators** can now manage integrations.

## 🛡️ What Was Secured

### Backend (API Endpoints)

All integration management endpoints now enforce **strict admin-only access**:

| Endpoint                                        | Method | Old Behavior | New Behavior                   |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `/api/integrations/google-drive/auth`           | GET    | Any user     | ✅ **Admin Only** (403 if not) |
| `/api/integrations/google-drive/callback`       | GET    | Any user     | ✅ **Admin Only** (403 if not) |
| `/api/integrations/google-drive/disconnect`     | POST   | Any user     | ✅ **Admin Only** (403 if not) |
| `/api/integrations/google-drive/folders`        | GET    | Any user     | ✅ **Admin Only** (403 if not) |
| `/api/integrations/google-drive/folders/update` | POST   | Any user     | ✅ **Admin Only** (403 if not) |

### Frontend (UI Components)

The UI now implements defense-in-depth security:

#### For Admins (ADMIN role):

- ✅ "Connect Google Drive" button visible
- ✅ "Disconnect" option in dropdown menu
- ✅ "Manage Folders" button visible
- ✅ Full control over integration settings

#### For Non-Admins (DEVELOPER, DESIGNER, MARKETER, CLIENT):

- ❌ "Connect" button hidden (replaced with "Contact admin" message)
- ❌ "Disconnect" option hidden from menu
- ❌ "Manage Folders" button hidden
- ℹ️ Clear messages directing users to contact admin
- ✅ Can still **view and use** files (respecting folder restrictions)

## 📊 Permission Matrix (Updated)

| Role      | Connect/Disconnect | Use Files | Manage Folders | Configure Access |
| --------- | ------------------ | --------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| ADMIN     | ✅                 | ✅        | ✅             | ✅               |
| DEVELOPER | ❌ (403)           | ✅        | ❌ (403)       | ❌ (403)         |
| DESIGNER  | ❌ (403)           | ✅        | ❌ (403)       | ❌ (403)         |
| MARKETER  | ❌ (403)           | ✅        | ❌ (403)       | ❌ (403)         |
| CLIENT    | ❌ (403)           | ✅        | ❌ (403)       | ❌ (403)         |

## 🔐 Security Features

### Defense-in-Depth Layers

1. **UI Layer**: Hide management options from non-admins
2. **Client Layer**: Validate admin status before API calls
3. **API Layer**: Enforce admin role on server (cannot be bypassed)
4. **Database Layer**: All operations tied to validated workspace context

### Security Checks Flow

```
User Action (Connect/Disconnect/Manage)
         ↓
Check isAdmin in UI → false? Show "Contact admin"
         ↓
API Request (if admin UI check passes)
         ↓
getCurrentWorkspace(userId) → Get role
         ↓
isAdmin(role) → false? Return 403 Forbidden
         ↓
Execute Operation (if admin)
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### As Admin:

- [ ] Can see "Connect Google Drive" button
- [ ] Can successfully connect Google Drive
- [ ] Can see "Disconnect" option in dropdown
- [ ] Can successfully disconnect Google Drive
- [ ] Can see "Manage Folders" button
- [ ] Can select and configure folder access

### As Non-Admin (Developer/Designer/Marketer):

- [ ] Cannot see "Connect Google Drive" button
- [ ] See "Contact admin to connect" message instead
- [ ] Cannot see "Disconnect" option in dropdown
- [ ] Cannot see "Manage Folders" button
- [ ] Can still view and use Drive files
- [ ] See info banner about folder restrictions (if active)
- [ ] Direct API attempts return 403 Forbidden

### API Security Tests:

```bash
# Test as non-admin (should return 403)
curl -X GET /api/integrations/google-drive/auth
# Expected: {"error": "Forbidden: Only workspace admins can connect integrations"}

curl -X POST /api/integrations/google-drive/disconnect
# Expected: {"error": "Forbidden: Only workspace admins can disconnect integrations"}

curl -X GET /api/integrations/google-drive/folders
# Expected: {"error": "Forbidden: Only admins can manage folder access"}

curl -X POST /api/integrations/google-drive/folders/update \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"folderIds": ["some_id"]}'
# Expected: {"error": "Forbidden: Only admins can update folder permissions"}
```

## 🚨 Why This Matters

### Prevents:

1. **Data Leaks**: Non-admins cannot connect their personal Drive and expose company data
2. **Service Disruption**: Prevents accidental or malicious disconnection by team members
3. **Unauthorized Access**: Ensures only trusted admins control workspace integrations
4. **Configuration Tampering**: Protects folder access rules from unauthorized changes

### Follows Industry Standards:

- **Slack**: Only workspace admins can install/remove apps
- **ClickUp**: Only workspace admins can connect integrations
- **Microsoft Teams**: Only admins can manage organization apps
- **Notion**: Only workspace owners/admins can manage integrations

## 🎯 Summary

**Before:** Any team member could connect/disconnect workspace integrations → **Security Risk** ⚠️

**After:** Only workspace admins can manage integrations → **Secure** ✅

This fix aligns Nextoria Hub with industry-standard security practices used by Slack, ClickUp, and other enterprise collaboration tools.
