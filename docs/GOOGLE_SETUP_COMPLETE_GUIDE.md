---

## PART 3: Configure OAuth Consent Screen (3 minutes)

**This is where you'll add test users and scopes!**

### Step 3.1: Navigate to OAuth Consent Screen

1. Click **‚ò∞ Menu** (top left)
2. Go to **"APIs & Services"**
3. Click **"OAuth consent screen"** (in the left sidebar)

**IMPORTANT:** You should see either:

```
‚óã Internal  (Only available if you have Google Workspace)
‚óã External  ‚Üê Select this one
```

1. Select **"External"**
2. Click **"CREATE"**

**If you DON'T see this screen:**

- You already configured it!
- Click **"EDIT APP"** button (top of page)
- This will let you go through the wizard again

### Step 3.3: Fill Out App Information

**Page 1: OAuth consent screen**

Fill in these fields:

```
App name: Nextoria Hub

User support email: [Select your email from dropdown]

App logo: [Skip for now - optional]

Application home page: http://localhost:3000

Application privacy policy: http://localhost:3000/privacy (optional for testing)

Authorized domains: [Leave empty for now]

Developer contact information: your-email@gmail.com
```

3. Click **"SAVE AND CONTINUE"** (bottom of page)

### Step 3.4: Add Scopes ‚≠ê (THIS IS WHERE THE SCOPES ARE!)

**Page 2: Scopes**

1. Click **"ADD OR REMOVE SCOPES"** button
2. A panel slides in from the right

**Now you need to add 3 scopes. Here's how:**

#### Scope 1 & 2: Google Drive Scopes

3. In the **"Filter"** box at the top, type: **"drive"**
4. You'll see a list of Google Drive API scopes
5. Find and **check the boxes** for these TWO scopes:

```
‚òë .../auth/drive.file
   See, edit, create, and delete only the specific Google Drive files you use with this app

‚òë .../auth/drive.readonly
   See and download all your Google Drive files
```

#### Scope 3: Email Scope

6. **Clear the filter box** (delete "drive")
7. In the **"Filter"** box, type: **"email"**
8. Scroll down and find **"Google OAuth2 API v2"** section
9. Check the box for:

```
‚òë .../auth/userinfo.email
   View your email address
```

**Or alternatively:** Type the full URL in the manual entry field at the bottom:

```
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email
```

#### Finish Adding Scopes

10. Click **"UPDATE"** (bottom of the panel)
11. You should now see **"3 scopes"** in the table
12. Click **"SAVE AND CONTINUE"** (bottom of page)

**Troubleshooting Scopes:**

- If you can't find a scope, try searching for just part of the name
- The email scope is under "Google OAuth2 API v2", not Google Drive API
- You can also manually paste the full scope URLs

### Step 3.5: Add Test Users ‚≠ê (THIS IS WHERE TEST USERS ARE!)

**IMPORTANT: Test users are on Page 3 of the OAuth Consent Screen wizard!**

**If you're going through the wizard:**

**Page 3: Test users**

1. You should see a page titled **"Test users"** at the top
2. Below it, you'll see a section that says **"No test users"** or shows existing users
3. Click **"+ ADD USERS"** button (on the right side)
4. A small popup appears titled "Add test users"
5. Type your email: **your-email@gmail.com**
6. Press **Enter** or click outside the box
7. Click **"Add"** button in the popup
8. You should now see your email listed with a small X next to it
9. Click **"SAVE AND CONTINUE"** (bottom of page)

**If you don't see "Test users" page:**

This means you skipped through the wizard too fast or already configured it!

**Solution:**

1. Go back to **OAuth consent screen** (left sidebar)
2. Look for **"EDIT APP"** button at the top
3. Click **"EDIT APP"**
4. Click through pages 1 and 2 (just click "Save and Continue")
5. **Page 3 is Test users** - add your email here!
6. Click "Save and Continue" to finish

### Step 3.6: Summary

**Page 4: Summary**

1. Review everything
2. Click **"BACK TO DASHBOARD"**

‚úÖ Done with OAuth consent screen!

2. Go to **"APIs & Services"**
3. Click **"Credentials"** (in the left sidebar)

### Step 4.2: Create OAuth Client ID

1. Click **"+ CREATE CREDENTIALS"** (top of page)
2. Select **"OAuth client ID"**

### Step 4.3: Configure OAuth Client

**Application type:**

- Select **"Web application"**

**Name:**

- Enter: **"Nextoria Hub Web Client"**

**Authorized JavaScript origins:**

- Leave empty (not needed)

**Authorized redirect URIs:**

http://localhost:3000/api/integrations/google-drive/callback
```

### Step 4.4: Create and Copy Credentials

1. Click **"CREATE"** button
2. A popup appears with your credentials!

**‚≠ê COPY THESE NOW - You need them for .env file:**

```
Your Client ID
1234567890-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.apps.googleusercontent.com

Your Client Secret
GOCSPX-AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz
```

3. Click **"DOWNLOAD JSON"** (optional, for backup)
4. Click **"OK"**

‚úÖ Keep these credentials safe!

## PART 5: Configure Your App (2 minutes)

### Step 5.1: Add Environment Variables

Open your `.env` file and add:

```env
# Google Drive Integration
GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id-here.apps.googleusercontent.com"
GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_SECRET="GOCSPX-your-client-secret-here"
GOOGLE_DRIVE_REDIRECT_URI="http://localhost:3000/api/integrations/google-drive/callback"
```

**Replace:**

- `your-client-id-here` with your actual Client ID
- `your-client-secret-here` with your actual Client Secret

**Example:**

```env
GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_ID="123456789-abc123def456.apps.googleusercontent.com"
GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_SECRET="GOCSPX-Abc123Def456Ghi789"
GOOGLE_DRIVE_REDIRECT_URI="http://localhost:3000/api/integrations/google-drive/callback"
```

### Step 5.2: Run Database Migration

```bash
cd /home/aymane-wrk/nextoria-hub
bun run db:push
```

**Or if that doesn't work:**

```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL < drizzle/migrations/create_drive_files_table.sql
```

### Step 5.3: Restart Your Dev Server

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
bun run dev
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Error: "Access blocked: Nextoria-hub has not completed verification"

**Solution:** You forgot to add yourself as test user!

**IMPORTANT:** Test users are NOT on the main OAuth consent screen page!

**How to add test users:**

1. Go to: Google Cloud Console
2. Navigate: APIs & Services ‚Üí OAuth consent screen
3. Click **"EDIT APP"** button (top of page)
4. Click through the wizard to **Page 3: Test users**

### Error: "Redirect URI mismatch"

**Solution:** Your redirect URI doesn't match!

Check that BOTH of these are EXACTLY the same:

**In Google Cloud Console (Credentials):**

```
http://localhost:3000/api/integrations/google-drive/callback
```

**In your .env file:**

```
GOOGLE_DRIVE_REDIRECT_URI="http://localhost:3000/api/integrations/google-drive/callback"
```

No extra spaces, no https (use http for localhost), no trailing slash!

### Error: "Google Drive not configured"

**Solution:** Environment variables not loaded

1. Check your `.env` file has all three variables
2. Make sure you restarted the dev server
3. Try `cat .env | grep GOOGLE_DRIVE` to verify

### Can't find OAuth consent screen

Make sure you're in the right project:

1. Check project name in top bar
2. Should say "Nextoria Hub" (or your project name)

## üÜò Still Stuck?

### Option 1: Check These Files

- `.env` - Has all variables?
- Server is running?
- Using correct email (test user)?

### Option 2: Start Fresh

Sometimes easier to start over:

1. Delete OAuth client in Credentials
2. Start from PART 4 again
3. Make sure redirect URI is exact

### Option 3: Screenshots

Take screenshots of:

1. Your OAuth consent screen (test users section)
2. Your credentials page (redirect URIs)
3. Your .env file (hide secrets!)
4. The error you're seeing

## üéì Understanding the Parts

**Project**: Container for your app in Google Cloud

**API**: Google Drive API - lets you access Drive programmatically

**OAuth Consent Screen**: What users see when granting permission

- **Scopes**: What permissions you're requesting (read Drive, etc.)
- **Test Users**: Who can use your unverified app

**Credentials**: Client ID & Secret - identifies your app to Google

**Redirect URI**: Where Google sends user after they approve

---

## üìù Exact Scope Names Reference

When adding scopes, here's what to search for and what you'll see:

### Search "drive" - You'll see:

```
Google Drive API
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file ‚úÖ CHECK THIS
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly ‚úÖ CHECK THIS
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (other drive scopes)
```

### Search "email" - You'll see:

```
Google OAuth2 API v2
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ openid
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email ‚úÖ CHECK THIS
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile
```

### Can't Find Email Scope? Use Manual Entry:

At the bottom of the scopes panel, there's usually a field to manually add scopes.

**Paste this full URL:**

```
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email
```

Then click "ADD" or press Enter.

### Final Check - You Should Have These 3:

```
1. https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file
2. https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly
3. https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email
```

## Next Steps

Once working:

- Add more test users (team members)
- Link Drive files to projects/tasks
- For production: Submit for Google verification

**Enjoy your Google Drive integration! üöÄ**
