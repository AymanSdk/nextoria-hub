# Fixing "Access blocked" Google OAuth Error

## The Error

```
Access blocked: Nextoria-hub has not completed the Google verification process
```

This happens because Google requires OAuth apps to be verified before external users can use them.

## Solution 1: Add Test Users (Quick Fix - Development)

This is the **fastest solution** for development and testing.

### Steps:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **"APIs & Services"** ‚Üí **"OAuth consent screen"**
4. Scroll down to **"Test users"** section
5. Click **"+ ADD USERS"**
6. Add the Google email addresses that need access (including yours!)
7. Click **"Save"**

### Important:

- You can add up to **100 test users** in development
- Test users can use the app immediately (no verification needed)
- Perfect for development, testing, and small teams

### Example:

```
Test Users:
- you@gmail.com
- teammate1@gmail.com
- teammate2@company.com
```

## Solution 2: Use Internal User Type (For Google Workspace)

If you have a **Google Workspace** account (not regular Gmail):

### Steps:

1. Go to **"OAuth consent screen"**
2. Change **User Type** to **"Internal"**
3. Click **"Save"**

### Benefits:

- No verification needed
- All users in your Google Workspace can use it
- No test user limits

### Limitations:

- Only works if you have Google Workspace
- Only users in your workspace can connect

## Solution 3: Verify Your App (For Production)

For production use with external users:

### Steps:

1. Go to **"OAuth consent screen"**
2. Click **"PUBLISH APP"**
3. Click **"Prepare for verification"**
4. Follow Google's verification process:
   - Add privacy policy URL
   - Add terms of service URL
   - Add app homepage URL
   - Provide YouTube demo video
   - Explain why you need Drive access

### Timeline:

- Google review takes **1-7 business days**
- May require additional information
- Required for public apps with external users

### When to use:

- Production apps with external users
- Public SaaS products
- Apps with > 100 users

## Solution 4: Bypass Warning (Development Only)

If you're a test user or developer:

### Steps:

1. When you see the warning screen
2. Look for **"Advanced"** link (bottom left)
3. Click **"Advanced"**
4. Click **"Go to Nextoria-hub (unsafe)"**
5. Grant permissions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:

- Only works if you're added as a test user
- Not available for non-test users
- Shows "unsafe" warning to users
