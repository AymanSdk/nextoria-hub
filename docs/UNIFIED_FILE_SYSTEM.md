## 🗂️ File Organization

### Database Schema

Files are stored in the `files` table with these relationships:

```sql
files
├── id (primary key)
├── name, mimeType, size
├── storageKey (S3 path)
├── storageUrl (S3 URL)
│
├── Relationships:
│   ├── projectId → projects
│   ├── taskId → tasks
│   ├── clientId → clients (✅ NEW!)
│   └── uploadedBy → users
│
├── Metadata:
│   ├── description
│   ├── tags
│   └── version
│
└── Flags:
    ├── isPublic
    └── isArchived
```

### S3 Folder Structure

```
your-bucket/
├── clients/
│   └── {client-id}/
│       └── deliverables/
│           └── {nanoid}.{ext}
│
├── projects/
│   └── {project-id}/
│       └── {nanoid}.{ext}
