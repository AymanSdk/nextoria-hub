# Activity Logging Integration

## Overview

Integrated real-time activity logging across the application to populate the Recent Activity feed on the homepage with live updates from user actions throughout the workspace.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Activity Feed UI

- **File**: `components/dashboard/activity-feed.tsx`
- Improved visual design with better avatars, icons, and hover effects
- Added color-coded activity type indicators
- Enhanced empty state with encouraging messaging
- Better responsive design and interactions

### 2. Enhanced Dashboard Card

- **File**: `app/(dashboard)/page.tsx`
- Updated Recent Activity card header with gradient styling
- Improved button hover states
- Better visual hierarchy

### 3. Integrated Activity Logging in API Routes

#### Tasks API (`app/api/tasks/route.ts`)

‚úÖ **POST /api/tasks** - Logs when tasks are created

- Tracks task creation with project context
- Shows task title and project name in activity feed

#### Task Updates API (`app/api/tasks/[taskId]/route.ts`)

‚úÖ **PATCH /api/tasks/[taskId]** - Logs task updates

- **Status Changes**: Tracks when tasks move between statuses (TODO, IN_PROGRESS, DONE, etc.)
- **Assignments**: Logs when tasks are assigned to team members
- **Updates**: Tracks general task updates (title, description, priority)

#### Projects API (`app/api/projects/route.ts`)

‚úÖ **POST /api/projects** - Logs project creation

- Tracks new project creation with project name

#### Project Updates API (`app/api/projects/[slug]/route.ts`)

‚úÖ **PATCH /api/projects/[slug]** - Logs project updates

- **Status Changes**: Tracks project status changes
- **Completion**: Special logging for project completions
- **Updates**: General project updates

#### Invoices API (`app/api/invoices/route.ts`)

‚úÖ **POST /api/invoices** - Logs invoice creation

- Tracks invoice creation or sending
- Shows invoice number and client name

### 4. Extended Activity Logger Functions

**File**: `src/lib/notifications/activity-logger.ts`

Added new helper functions:

- `logExpenseCreated()` - For expense submissions
- `logExpenseApproved()` - For expense approvals
- `logCampaignCreated()` - For campaign creation
- `logCampaignLaunched()` - For campaign launches
- `logInvoiceStatusChanged()` - For invoice status updates
- `logCommentAdded()` - For comments on entities

## Usage Examples

### Logging a Task Creation

```typescript
import { logTaskCreated } from "@/src/lib/notifications/activity-logger";

await logTaskCreated({
  workspaceId: membership.workspaceId,
  userId: user.id,
  taskId: task.id,
  taskTitle: task.title,
  projectName: project.name,
});
```

### Logging a Task Status Change

```typescript
import { logTaskStatusChanged } from "@/src/lib/notifications/activity-logger";

await logTaskStatusChanged({
  workspaceId: membership.workspaceId,
  userId: user.id,
  taskId: updatedTask.id,
  taskTitle: updatedTask.title,
  oldStatus: originalTask.status,
  newStatus: validated.status,
});
```

### Logging a Project Creation

```typescript
import { logProjectCreated } from "@/src/lib/notifications/activity-logger";

await logProjectCreated({
  workspaceId: validated.workspaceId,
  userId: user.id,
  projectId: project.id,
  projectName: project.name,
});
```

### Logging a Custom Activity

```typescript
import { logActivity } from "@/src/lib/notifications/activity-logger";

await logActivity({
  workspaceId: membership.workspaceId,
  userId: user.id,
  activityType: "CUSTOM_ACTION",
  entityType: "entity_type",
  entityId: entity.id,
  title: "performed custom action",
  description: "Optional description",
  metadata: { key: "value" },
});
```

## Integration Checklist

To add activity logging to a new feature:

1. ‚úÖ Import the appropriate logging function or use `logActivity`
2. ‚úÖ Get the user's workspace ID from `workspaceMembers` table
3. ‚úÖ Call the logging function after the action succeeds
4. ‚úÖ Handle errors gracefully (logging failures shouldn't break the main action)
5. ‚úÖ Add appropriate activity type constant if needed
6. ‚úÖ Update the icon mapping in `activity-feed.tsx` if using a new entity type

## Pending Integrations

The following areas could benefit from activity logging:

- [ ] **Expenses API** - Log expense creation and approval
- [ ] **Campaigns API** - Log campaign creation and launches
- [ ] **File Uploads** - Log file uploads to projects/tasks
- [ ] **Team Management** - Log member additions/removals
- [ ] **Comments** - Log comments on tasks/projects
- [ ] **Invoice Status Changes** - Log payment status updates
- [ ] **Project Milestones** - Log milestone achievements
- [ ] **Client Portal** - Log client interactions

## Database Schema

The activity logging uses the `activity_logs` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE activity_logs (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  workspace_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES workspaces(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id TEXT REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  activity_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  entity_type VARCHAR(50),
  entity_id TEXT,
  title VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  metadata TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL
);
```

## Performance Considerations

- Activities are limited to 10 most recent by default (configurable)
- Cascading deletes ensure cleanup when workspaces are deleted
- User deletions are set to NULL to preserve activity history
- Efficient indexing on `workspace_id` and `created_at`

## Testing

To test the activity feed:

1. Create a task ‚Üí Check Recent Activity
2. Update task status ‚Üí Verify status change appears
3. Create a project ‚Üí Confirm project creation shows
4. Create an invoice ‚Üí Check invoice activity
5. Multiple actions ‚Üí Verify chronological order

## Visual Features

- ‚ú® Color-coded icons by entity type
- üë§ User avatars with activity type badges
- üîó Clickable items link to entity pages
- ‚è∞ Relative timestamps ("2 minutes ago")
- üì± Responsive design for all screen sizes
- üé® Smooth hover animations
- üéØ Empty state with encouraging messaging

## Best Practices

1. **Always log after success**: Only log activities after the action succeeds
2. **Provide context**: Include relevant details (project name, client name, etc.)
3. **Keep titles concise**: Use clear, action-oriented language
4. **Use descriptions wisely**: Add extra context without cluttering
5. **Handle errors**: Log failures shouldn't break the user flow
6. **Be consistent**: Follow the existing patterns for similar actions

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Activity filtering by entity type
- [ ] User-specific activity views
- [ ] Activity search functionality
- [ ] Export activity logs
- [ ] Notification triggers from activities
- [ ] Activity analytics and insights
- [ ] Bulk activity operations
- [ ] Activity templates for common actions
